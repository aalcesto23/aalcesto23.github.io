What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that essentially all HTML elements are in a box format. Adding padding, borders, and margins can change the shape of the content and the space surrounding the content. Adding padding, borders, and margin give/take away space from a websites design. The padding is the area between the content and border, while the margin is the space outside the border. Both the padding and margins are defaulted to be transparent.

The actual CSS coding for positioning is very user-friendly and can be done quickly, but deciding on the actual positioning of an element can be difficult.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that adding and formatting elements with CSS can determing the overall feel of your website, so it is important to give it the attention and detail it deserves.
