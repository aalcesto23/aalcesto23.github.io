- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was interesting being able to collaborate on creating a wireframe with my partner, being able to bounce ideas off of each other. I feel like working together to create the wireframe made the process go a lot faster than creating one on your own. Working on the HTML went the same as creating the wireframe. I was nice being able to fill in the gaps in each other's code.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I find wireframing very helpful. When creating the wireframe you can already have an idea of how your code will look like, which helps the coding process go much faster.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a wirefram should be simple, something that is easy to build on in the future. For this exercise, our wireframe was minimal, so we can personalize it throughout Phase-0.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned how to use the <main></main> and <section></section> tags. I saw that we had used them in challenge 1.7, so I searched what was their use and how to implement them into my code.
