                Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

				One of the most important pieces of information I took away from the various articles was to create a learning environment that will allow you time to reflect on your work, and give self-praise for your efforts. This idea stems from the "Fogg Method," and by doing this it will provide motivation to work and stimulate productivity through building upon tiny habits. Ideally, these habits will work toward a long term change in improving your time management and productivity while working.
				What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

				Time Boxing is allotting a specific amount of time to steadily work on completing a task, rather than continuously working on the task until completion. It can be applied to Phase 0 by previously agreeing upon an amount of time to work on an assignment . This will provide time to reflect on one's work and come back with fresh thoughts, rather than forcefully producing results. Also, Time Boxing can assist in managing one's time to ensure certain assignments are given the correct amount of time needed to complete them.
				How do you manage your time currently?

				Currently, I tend to procrastinate on work as a defense mechanism due to a lack of knowledge or fear of failure. Since I procrastinate, I will leave all the work up until the very last moment actions need to be made or things need to be submitted.
				Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

				I don't think that my current strategy is working. This strategy puts a lot of stress on me to complete assignments, so I tend to focus solely on finishing, even if that means not retaining the information. A lot of times during college I would pull all-nighters to study for an exam the night before, then after taking the exam I'm unable recall any of the information I studied. Though, I enjoy working under pressure and it helps me focus, I want to implement a strategy that will break the habit of cramming information and not learning anything from it.
				Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

				I will focus on Time Boxing my workload through out my time at DBC, and hopefully in my future work place. Specifically for DBC, I will evaluate my weekly assignments at the start of each week and Time Box the assignments with the suggested amount of time in mind to allow myself to take breaks and evaluate my work. This will allow me time to celebrate my success and look into my failures for opportunities to grow.
				What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

				I plan to create good habits to keep myself motivated to work and avoid procrastinating. I want to provide myself time to really think about the things I am working on by building that into my schedule/time management. Overall, I am going to space out my work so I can work comfortably, while retaining the information and staying productive.

- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was interesting being able to collaborate on creating a wireframe with my partner, being able to bounce ideas off of each other. I feel like working together to create the wireframe made the process go a lot faster than creating one on your own. Working on the HTML went the same as creating the wireframe. I was nice being able to fill in the gaps in each other's code.

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I find wireframing very helpful. When creating the wireframe you can already have an idea of how your code will look like, which helps the coding process go much faster.

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that a wirefram should be simple, something that is easy to build on in the future. For this exercise, our wireframe was minimal, so we can personalize it throughout Phase-0.

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned how to use the <main></main> and <section></section> tags. I saw that we had used them in challenge 1.7, so I searched what was their use and how to implement them into my code.
