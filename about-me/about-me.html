   			<p>
               My name is Alan Alcesto. I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but spent most of my childhood in Huntley. I later moved back to Chicago to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). During my four years at UIC I studied Psychology with a minor in Asian-American Studies. I was heavily involved in advocating for the Asian American community through service organizations and my fraternity, Kappa Pi Beta. I am currently attending Dev Bootcamp with the Island Foxes cohort in hopes of becoming a full-stack junior developer.

				I just started my journey in the learning software development, and it has really enveloped my life. Though I am currently focusing on honing my coding skills, I have plenty of other interests. Like in college, I am still an advote for the Asian American community. I try to keep myself informed and attend events whenever I am available.
			</p>

				As of recently I have been really health concious. With that, I run and work out daily. It's a great way to relieve stress and justify eating poorly. Other than coding and working out, I enjoy playing video games in my free time. I mainly play League of Legends (for wonderfully toxic community) and console RPGs. I also spend a lot of time with my dog, Mochi, and cooking with my girlfriend.
			</p>
			<p> Fun Fact: I hate eggs. They offend all five of my senses.
